# Docker Runtime

## Production topology

`docker-compose.yml` defines:

- `postgres`: PostgreSQL 16 with authenticated health check.
- `redis`: Redis 7 with password and authenticated health check.
- `backend`: published FreeLingo image; waits for PostgreSQL and Redis, applies existing Alembic
  revisions, then starts Uvicorn.
- `frontend`: published FreeLingo image; exposes port 3000 and talks to backend through private
  `BACKEND_URL`.
- `kokoro`: version-pinned local CPU TTS image, used when `TTS_PROVIDER=local`.
- `whisper`: version-pinned local CPU STT image, used when `STT_PROVIDER=local`.

Ollama is not a Compose service. The default configuration expects it on the host through
`host.docker.internal:11434`. The backend service declares the Linux host-gateway mapping.

## Development topology

`docker-compose.dev.yml` defines PostgreSQL, Redis, a locally built backend with source mount and
Uvicorn reload, and a locally built frontend with source/message mounts and `npm run dev`.

It does not define Kokoro or Whisper. Development must therefore select external/cloud speech
providers or compose the missing local services separately. Its default local speech hostnames are not
services contained in that file.

`frontend/Dockerfile.dev` is used only by development Compose. Publishing workflows use the production
backend and frontend Dockerfiles.

## Images and publication

Backend images use Python 3.14 and pip 26.2.1 with `requirements.txt` plus `constraints.txt`.
Frontend production/development images use Node 25, explicitly install npm 11, and use the committed
lockfile through `npm ci`. Production uses Next.js standalone output.

Push workflows for `main` and `develop` build and publish separate Linux `amd64` and `arm64` image
names with `latest` and short-SHA tags. They publish images only; they do not deploy to a VPS.

## Persistence

The Compose files use bind mounts below `DATA_PATH`; they do not declare named volumes.

- PostgreSQL: `${DATA_PATH}/postgres`.
- Redis: `${DATA_PATH}/redis`.
- Avatars: `${DATA_PATH}/avatars`.
- Generated audio: `${DATA_PATH}/audio`.
- TTS previews: `${DATA_PATH}/tts_previews`.
- Whisper model cache: `${DATA_PATH}/whisper-cache`.

Avatar and media access remains controlled by backend endpoints; a host mount does not make files
public.

## Environment propagation

`.env.example` is the operator-facing deployment template. Compose explicitly forwards environment
values; a field present in backend `Settings` but absent from Compose is not configurable merely by
placing it in `.env`.

Operators must review database/data path, Redis password, JWT secret, CORS/cookie security,
registration, email, available languages, LLM/speech providers, quotas, Stripe/freemium, logging, and
analytics settings.

Both Compose files forward `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `MINIMAX_BASE_URL`, and `MINIMAX_MODEL` to the backend.
The API key has no default and must remain outside version control; the base URL and model default to
the official MiniMax OpenAI-compatible endpoint and `MiniMax-M2.7`.

`BACKEND_URL` is the frontend's private backend-connectivity variable. The frontend also receives the
optional public Umami script and site identifiers.

The production and development Compose files currently inject an `AVAILABLE_TARGET_LANGUAGES`
fallback containing only `en-US` and `en-GB` when the variable is absent, while `Settings` and
`.env.example` default to the complete supported set. Operators should provide the explicit value from
`.env.example`; the injected Compose value takes precedence.

`ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED`, and
`AUDIO_STORAGE_PATH` exist in backend Settings but are not forwarded by the current Compose contract.
Their in-code defaults therefore apply in containers.

## Startup and migrations

The backend startup command applies existing Alembic revisions before starting Uvicorn. This does not
create or review migration files. Migration generation/application outside normal startup belongs to
the remote deployment maintainer; migrations are not created locally.

## CPU speech and provider selection

Production Compose pins Kokoro CPU `v0.9.0` and faster-whisper web service `v1.9.1`. Kokoro is limited
to 2 CPUs and 2500 MiB; Whisper is limited to 2 CPUs and 1500 MiB, uses the `base` model by default,
and stores downloaded model data in the persistent cache mount.

When TTS or STT uses OpenAI, the corresponding local speech service is unnecessary. LLM, TTS, STT,
recognition-language, and provider HTTP contracts belong to `services.instructions.md` and
`speech-services.instructions.md`.

The backend and frontend tolerate stopped local speech containers. Audio playback requires TTS,
recording requires STT, and voice conversation requires both; unrelated features remain available.

## Host requirements

- Set `vm.overcommit_memory=1` for reliable Redis background persistence.
- Production voice conversation requires HTTPS and a reverse proxy that forwards `/ws/*` to backend.
- Keep provider API keys and `CHANGE_ME_*` secrets out of version control.
- Keep backend/frontend runtime and package-manager versions aligned with their PR/publish workflows
  when intentionally upgrading them.
